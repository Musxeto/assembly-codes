# 8086 Assembly Language Codes (MASM)

Welcome to the 8086 Assembly language codes repository! This collection includes various assembly language programs written for the 8086 microprocessor using the emu8086.

## Introduction

This repository contains my implementations of 8086 Assembly language programs using MASM. The programs cover a range of topics, including basic instructions, input/output operations, control flow, and more. They were developed during my 3rd semester at LGU, serving as a learning resource for assembly language programming for the 8086 microprocessor.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own learning or academic purposes. It's advisable to have a basic understanding of assembly language concepts before diving into these programs.

## Usage

To use the programs in this repository, follow these general steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Musxeto/assembly-codes.git
## Conclusion:
Keep in mind that the code is provided as-is, and it's recommended to understand the logic behind each implementation before using them in your projects or assignments.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or improvements to suggest!
